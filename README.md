# Unexpected Route Matching in React Router v6

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router v6: unexpected route matching and navigation problems.  Routes may not match as expected, leading to incorrect page renders or navigation failures.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version, addressing the issue of unexpected route matching.  This example showcases how improper route definitions or interactions can disrupt the routing functionality.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe the unexpected routing behavior by navigating between routes.

## Solution

Refer to `bugSolution.js` for a solution that correctly defines the routes and handles navigation to prevent the unexpected route matching behavior.
